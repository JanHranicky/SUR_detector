# Intro 

The repository contains two detectors trained on a specific (school project) dataset. Detectors were trained to detect predefined person based on their voice and face. Both detectors were implemented using a convolution neural network. 

The main challenge in this project was lack of data in the given dataset. One of the ways this project deals with the problem is data augmentation. Both detectors were fairly successfull
